## Migration Plan for Scalability

- Current: Data stored in JSON files with file-locking.
- Next: Abstracted data access in `bot_utils.py` allows easy migration.
- Future: Swap JSON for SQLite or Firebase by updating functions in `bot_utils.py` only.
- Benefit: No need to rewrite handlers or business logic—just update the data layer.
