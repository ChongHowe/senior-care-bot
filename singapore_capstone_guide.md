## 📊 Three ML Models (Singapore-Optimized)

### Model 1: Medication Adherence Prediction
**Singapore Context:** 
- Factors in HDB housing types (elderly-friendly features)
- Considers Singapore's healthcare subsidies (Medisave, Pioneer Generation)
- Incorporates local cultural factors (traditional medicine usage)

### Model 2: Fall Risk Assessment
**Singapore Context:**
- Weather patterns (monsoon seasons affect mobility)
- HDB flat layouts and accessibility features
- Singapore's tropical climate impact on senior activity

### Model 3: Health Anomaly Detection
**Singapore Context:**
- Integration with Singapore's healthcare system
- Consider local disease patterns (diabetes rates in Asian populations)
- Factor in Singapore's healthcare accessibility
